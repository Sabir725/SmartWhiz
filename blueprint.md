# SmartWhiz Edutech Website Blueprint

## **1. Project Overview**

The SmartWhiz Edutech website is a modern, responsive, and user-friendly platform designed to serve as the digital face of the admission consultancy. It aims to attract and engage prospective students and their families by providing comprehensive information about educational opportunities and admission guidance. The website is built with a mobile-first approach, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices. A key feature is the dynamic and searchable blog section, which provides valuable content to users and establishes SmartWhiz Edutech as a thought leader in the education consultancy space.

## **2. Design and Style**

The website's design is clean, modern, and professional, reflecting the brand identity of SmartWhiz Edutech. The aesthetic is carefully crafted to be visually appealing and to create a positive user experience.

*   **Color Palette:** The primary color scheme is a gradient of blue and purple (`#007bff` to `#6f42c1`), creating a sense of trust, professionalism, and creativity. The secondary color is a clean white (`#fff`), used for backgrounds and text to ensure readability. Accent colors are used for buttons and other interactive elements.

*   **Typography:** A modern, sans-serif font is used for all text, ensuring readability and a consistent look and feel across the site. Font sizes are used to create a clear visual hierarchy, with large, bold headings for titles and smaller sizes for body text.

*   **Layout:** The layout is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate. A top bar provides contact information and social media links, while the main navigation bar offers access to all major sections of the site. The content is organized in a logical and visually balanced manner, with ample white space to improve readability and reduce clutter.

*   **Iconography:** The website uses the Font Awesome library to provide a rich set of icons that enhance the user interface and improve visual communication.

## **3. Features**

The website is packed with features designed to provide a comprehensive and engaging user experience.

*   **Responsive Design:** The website is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes to provide an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

*   **Dynamic Blog Section:** The `blogs.html` page features a dynamic and searchable blog section. The blog posts are loaded from a `blogs.json` file, making it easy to add, remove, or update content without having to modify the HTML. This section includes:
    *   **Search Functionality:** A prominent search bar allows users to search for blog posts by keywords. The search is powered by a client-side search library, providing instant results.
    *   **Trending Searches:** A "Top Searches" section provides users with a list of popular keywords, helping them to discover relevant content.
    *   **Blog Cards:** Each blog post is displayed in a visually appealing "card" format, with a featured image, title, description, and a "Read More" button.

*   **Navigation:** A clear and intuitive navigation bar allows users to easily access all sections of the website.

*   **Contact Information:** The website provides multiple ways for users to get in touch with SmartWhiz Edutech, including a top bar with contact details, a dedicated contact section, and an "Enquiry Now" button.

*   **Social Media Integration:** The website is integrated with social media, with links to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram.

## **4. Current Plan**

With the design and features implemented, the next step is to deploy the website to a live server, making it accessible to the public.
